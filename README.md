# Cujae LDAP Manager

The Cujae LDAP Manager is a Node.js-based web application for managing users and groups in an LDAP service. It is designed specifically for the Cujae University community, but can be easily adapted for use in other organizations.

## Features

- Authentication: users can authenticate against the LDAP server to access protected resources.
- Authorization: groups can be used to control access to protected resources.
- RESTful API: provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with the LDAP service programmatically.
- MongoDB integration: the application stores its configuration data in a MongoDB database, which makes it easy to scale and manage.

## Technology Stack

- Node.js: a JavaScript runtime that allows for building scalable and high-performance applications.
- Express: a popular web framework for Node.js that provides robust routing, middleware, and other features.
